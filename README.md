# Tetris-Website
We were tasked with creating a Tetris website, which allowed users to create an account and have their score on a leaderboard. The game itself was programmed using Javascript, while the server tasks, such as saving scores or logging in, where made using PHP and SQL. HTML and CSS were used to design and style the website.
